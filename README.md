# Apps Script React
I use React and MUI for building small web apps that are run within google workspace for my school. This is my first attempt at having some boilerplate for these types of projects. 


# setup
npm init -y

npm install -D @google/clasp
npm install --save-dev parcel    
npm install react react-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

npm run glogin

npm run gcreate

npm -i -D @types/google-apps-script

npm run gpull

npm run gpush


# dev

npm run start

# build

npm run build
npm gpush
